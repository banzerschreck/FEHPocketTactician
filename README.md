##Fire Emblem Heroes Pocket Tactician!

A little pet project of mine that hopefully turns into something useful for the community

This project started as a class project during my senior year at IUP, check that version out here:

Built completely from the ground up, trimming the fat of MongoDB and janky workarounds through GitHub page hosting!

Thanks for checking this out, and may Sothis bless your summoning sessions.
